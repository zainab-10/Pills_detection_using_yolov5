## Pills Detection using YOLOv5
Welcome to the "Pills Detection using YOLOv5" GitHub repository! 
Here, we present an innovative solution for detecting and localizing pills in images using the YOLOv5 object detection framework. 
Our repository includes not only the code and model but also the dataset used for training and the resulting prediction images.

## Introduction
The "Pills Detection using YOLOv5" project is a groundbreaking initiative in the domain of pharmaceutical quality control and automation. 
By leveraging the YOLOv5 object detection framework, renowned for its real-time capabilities, we have created a robust tool 
to identify and locate pills in images. 
This project finds applications in pharmaceutical manufacturing, drug inspection, and medical research.

## Dataset
Our repository includes the dataset meticulously compiled for training the YOLOv5 model. 
This dataset contains diverse images of pills, annotated with bounding boxes to precisely define their locations. 
This annotated dataset forms the backbone of our model's training, enabling accurate pill detection.

## Prediction Images
Explore the "prediction_images" directory to witness the results of our trained model's predictions. 
These images offer a visual representation of the YOLOv5 model's prowess, showcasing its ability to identify and localize pills within various images.
